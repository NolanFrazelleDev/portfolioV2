I want to redo my portfolio. Use bootstrap. My ideas for it are to be fairly barebones. Simple, very responsive and has a robuist demonstartion and form section. I need to include "things I can do," "Things I have done," and skills. Skills are like JS, Node, etc..

Things to do: 
 - Whiteboard overall design of the website
 - Start a git repo 
 - Start building
